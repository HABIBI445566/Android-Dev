For each **Project** recommendation, aim to integrate real use cases; for example, when learning **RoomDB**, create a small note-taking app. For **Notes**, document concepts, important patterns, and debugging techniques. For **Project + Notes**, combine hands-on experience with theory to solidify understanding, especially for complex topics like **MVVM** and **Hilt**.
